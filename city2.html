        <p style="color: white;">The world is home to some 4,416 cities - from the crumbling grandeur of Rome to the bristling, ultra-modern towers of Shanghai. It includes tiny Adamstown, a microscopic settlement in the Pitcairn Islands with a population of only 48; it includes Venice, a floating city laced by idyllic canals and breathtaking palazzos. And like the people who inhabit them, each has its own distinctive personality, allure, photo-worthy moments, and reasons to pay them a visit. Here, in our humble opinion, are the world’s most special cities.

          <h2>History</h2>
          Architecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II. Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce. <br><br>
          Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo also features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower, and the new Tokyo Skytree, which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

            Tokyo is one of the world's most exciting dining destinations. The city features a wide range of both local and regional Japanese cuisine in addition to all types of international fare. Its top restaurants have accrued more Michelin stars than both Paris and New York combined. But good food can be found at every price range from cheap hole-in-the-wall joints to expensive high-class restaurants with every budget in between. <br> <br>
            As Japan's political center for over four centuries, Tokyo has naturally exerted great influence on Japanese cuisine. Consequently, some Tokyo specialties have become so popular that they are now known as the standard version of the dish rather than a local specialty.

These population estimates and projections come from the latest revision of the UN World Urbanization Prospects. These estimates represent the Urban agglomeration of Tokyo, which typically includes Tokyo's population in addition to adjacent suburban areas. <br><br>
          According to recent estimates, the 23 wards that make up the city of Tokyo had an approximate 2016 population of 9,262,046. The 23 wards made up the boundaries of the historic city of Tokyo, which was officially dissolved in 1943 when it merged with the prefecture. Today, Tokyo extends way beyond the original city boundaries, and is one of the largest urban sprawls in the world, which doesn't make it easy to explain exactly how many people live in Tokyo.</td>

      <h2>Early history</h2>
      <p>In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company.He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange. Hudson's first mate described the harbor as "a very good Harbour for all windes" and the river as "a mile broad" and "full of fish". Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles (240 km) north, past the site of the present-day New York State capital city of Albany, in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue.He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (New Netherland). <br> <br>
      The first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Juan Rodriguez (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues), a merchant from Santo Domingo. Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.</p>

          <br><br>
         New York City was also the founding city of New York Restaurant Week which has spread around the world due to the discounted prices that such a deal offers. In New York City there are over 12,000 bodegas, delis and groceries and many among them are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Much of the cuisine usually associated with New York City stems in part from its large community of Ashkenazi Jews and their descendants. The world famous New York institution of the "Delicatessen," commonly referred to as a "Deli," was originally an institution of the city's Jewry. </td>

        <h1>History</h1>
        Seoul is first recorded as Wiryeseong, the capital of Baekje (founded in 18 BC) in the northeastern area of modern Seoul. There are several city walls remaining in the area that date from this time. Pungnaptoseong, an earthen wall located southeast Seoul, is widely believed to have been at the main Wiryeseong site. As the Three Kingdoms competed for this strategic region, control passed from Baekje to Goguryeo in the 5th century, and from Goguryeo to Silla in the 6th century. <br><br>
        Following the war, Seoul began to focus on reconstruction and modernization. As South Korea's economy started to grow rapidly from the 1960s, urbanization also accelerated and workers began to move to Seoul and other larger cities. <br><br>
        Until 1972, Seoul was claimed by North Korea as its de jure capital, being specified as such in Article 103 of the 1948 North Korean constitution

          <td>Korean cuisine is the customary cooking traditions and practices of the culinary arts of Korea. Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine has evolved through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.
          Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, and (at least in the South) meats. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, gochugaru (pepper flakes), gochujang (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage. <br><br>
          Ingredients and dishes vary by province. Many regional dishes have become national, and dishes that were once regional have proliferated in different variations across the country. Korean royal court cuisine once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Foods are regulated by Korean cultural etiquette.</td>

           The most endearing thing about the culture of Seoul is the constant wish to maintain peace and harmony. This is evident from the acts of sharing food with one another, respecting elders, travelling in groups, etc. Seoul is the cultural hub of South Korea, with several art galleries and museums, along with Buddhist temples and monasteries as an epitome of architectural excellence. <br><br>
           The Lunar New Year, which falls on the first day of spring and Thanksgiving in Autumn are the two main festivals celebrated by the people of Seoul. Time of harvest is celebrated with Chusok when the people pay respect to their ancestors by cooking traditional food and performing rituals. Making merry is an important part of the South Korean culture. Food is a common obsession among the people of Seoul. The inhabitants are extremely critical about the various versions of every dish, which explains the streets filled with joints serving the same, their own versions of it. Barbeque is a popular type of cooking in the city which has even made a mark on the outer radar.

      <p>Uniquely among Italy’s chief cities, Venice came into being after the fall of the Roman Empire in the West. The Lombard hordes, whose incursions into northern Italy began in AD 568, drove great numbers of mainlanders onto the islands of the lagoon, previously the homes of itinerant fishermen and salt workers. The isolated communities, literally islands of Veneto-Byzantine civilization, became part of the exarchate of Ravenna when it was created in 584. When the mainland Byzantine city of Oderzo fell to the Lombards in 641, political authority was shifted to one of the islands in the Venetian lagoon.</p>

          The culture of Venice, or Venezia as the locals call it, is characterized by the uniqueness of its people and the influence of its history. Venice’s reputation throughout the world tends to be based on the colorful decadence of its famed Carnival, though the city’s nickname, La Serenissima, meaning “The Most Serene Republic,” is also appropriate. 
          <br><br>
          The city’s bustling streets and passion for individuality is as notable as its noble history and quiet suburbs.Since Venice’s early days, it has been considered one of the most important cities of the Italian Peninsula. It’s origins as an important maritime republic solidified the city’s rich commerce and valuable connections in the Mediterranean Sea and Far East. The noblemen of Venice were highly committed to cultivating art, philosophy, poetry, and architecture, setting the bar for current day Venice’s deep appreciation for all things artistic. The stunning palaces and gorgeous waters of the lagoon set the stage in ancient Venice for countless parties and social gatherings, influencing the modern-day culture of social enjoyment and connection.
           <br><br>
          The two most iconic symbols of Venice – the gondola and the Carnival –perfectly represent the city’s culture.

                    <p>Another 233 people in the UK have died from coronavirus as the country's death toll continues to
                        grow.</p>

                        homes and the broader community.</p>
                    <p>The number is a slight fall on last Tuesday's daily death toll, which was 286.</p>
                    <p>it is vastly higher than the 38 deaths recorded on Monday, although this marked difference is
                        usually because of a lag in weekend reporting.</p>
                    <p>The figures remain stubbornly high as the UK continues with easing lockdown.</p>
                    <p>Earlier government adviser Sir John Bell warned that he would be very surprised if the UK managed
                        to avoid a second wave of infections.</p>

                    <p>The Department of Health announced that 1,279 more people have tested positive for the
                        coronavirus, bringing the country wide total to 298,136 confirmed cases so far.</p>
                    <p>This is slightly lower than the 1,387 reported a week ago today, but more than the 1,056 cases
                        recorded yesterday.</p>
                    <p>An additional 113,107 tests were taken in the past day.</p>
                    <p>Earlier today it was announced that 93 people who had caught the disease had died in UK
                        hospitals.</p>
                    <p>England reported 79 new deaths, Wales had eight, Scotland recorded five, and Northern Ireland had
                        one amid fears the UK could see a second wave of Covid-19.</p>

                        to June 5 and had been registered by June 13.</p>
                    <p>It means 53,077 deaths have been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death
                        certificate, including suspected cases, nearly 11,000 more than the official toll.</p>
                    <p>According to the latest weekly breakdown from the ONS, coronavirus-related deaths in England and
                        Wales have fallen to their lowest number since lockdown was first implemented.</p>
                    <p>A total of 1,588 deaths registered in the week ending June 5 mentioned Covid-19, down from 1,822

                    <p>There have been more than 64,400 excess deaths in the UK since the outbreak began, and Covid-19

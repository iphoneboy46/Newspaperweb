                    <p>ABOUT 12 million low-income people are at risk of missing out on the federal government's
                        stimulus checks because they don't earn enough money.</p>
                    <p>According to an estimate by The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the 12 million low-income
                        earners are not included in the tax system and so will miss out on their payment.</p>

                    <p>The millions of people who are at risk of not receiving the stimulus checks are mainly low-income
                        black and Hispanic people in the U.S.</p>
                    <p>By law, individuals who earn less than $12,200 are not required to file any taxes, and that
                        threshold is doubled for married couples.</p>
                    <p>It will be these people who won't qualify to receive the stimulus payments.</p>
                    <p>Most people across the US have received the payment automatically but many who aren't normally
                        required to file taxes must submit information to the Internal Revenue Service by October 15 in
                        order to receive a check.</p>

                    <p>Since these people aren't in the IRS system, they must file a basic form using an online
                        "non-filer" tool that the agency created for the stimulus system.</p>
                    <p>More than four million people have used the non-filer tool to get payments so far, according to
                        the House Ways and Means Committee.</p>
                    <p>The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think-tank, is calling on states to help notify
                        people that they may be eligible for the money.

                    </p>
                    <p>The stimulus program was created by Congress in late March as part of its $2 trillion coronavirus
                        aid package.</p>
                    <p>The IRS began sending out its first payments in mid-April.</p>
                    <p>The bipartisan plan signed by President Trump gave financial assistance to millions who have been
                        impacted by the pandemic.</p>

                    <p>“This is a response to an invasion," Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania told reporters
                        recently.</p>
                    <p>“This is the kind of thing you’d have to do if we were at war.”</p>
                    <p>He added that failing to act now "would be a wildly imprudent thing, and it would probably result
                        in such a severe recession — it might very well be a depression — and it could take decades to
                        come out of this.”</p>
                    <p>On June 3, the IRS said it had sent money to all eligible Americans, totaling 159 million
                        payments worth $267billion.</p>
                    <p>Eligibility for the payments is largely based on income, and it excludes individuals earning more
                        than $99,000, head of household filers with one child who earn more than $136,500, and married
                        couples without children earning more than $198,000.</p>
                    <p>The payments are worth up to $1,200 per individual and up to $2,400 per couple, plus an
                        additional $500 for each dependent.</p>
                    <p>Donald Trump's economic adviser Larry Kudlow has vowed to end the weekly $600 unemployment
                        checks.
                    </p>
                    <p>Kudlow branded the checks a disincentive to work and laid out plans to replace them with some
                        kind of back-to-work bonus.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Speaking on CNN, he explained the White House intends to scrap the scheme when it expires in July
                        and roll out new legislation.

                    </p>
                    <p>He said: “The $600 plus-up that’s above the state unemployment benefits they will continue to
                        receive is in effect a disincentive.
                    </p>
                    <p>"I mean, we're paying people not to work. It's better than what their salaries get.
                    </p>
                    <p>"That might have worked for the first couple of months. It will end in late July."

                    </p>
                    <p>It comes as 40million Americans are believed to have lost their jobs due to the coronavirus
                        pandemic - which has killed 118,286 and infected 2.2million in the US.

                    </p>
                    <p>American unemployment is at its highest since records began as businesses closed across the
                        country due to the outbreak.
                    </p>
                    <p>The $600-a-week checks were part of Trump's $2.2trillion rescue package which was signed into law
                        in March.

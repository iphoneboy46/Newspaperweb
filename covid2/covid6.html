                    <p>LONDON is the first region to emerge from the coronavirus crisis after the capital recorded fewer
                        deaths than in a normal week.</p>
                    <p>Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that since March, London has seen
                        fewer deaths than it did before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

                    <p>In the week up to June 5 there were almost three per cent fewer people dying in the capital
                        compared with the five-year average.</p>
                    <p>London had previously been a hot spot of the virus.</p>
                    <p>Deaths in hospitals across the capital have however dropped significantly in the last month.</p>
                    <p>Over the same time period the ONS found that the North West had the highest number of deaths
                        involving Covid-19.</p>

                    <p>The North West had 12 per cent more deaths than usual.</p>
                    <p>The pandemic is currently at different stages in the UK with the South East and Yorkshire & the
                        Humber coming slightly behind the North West when it comes to deaths caused by the virus.</p>
                    <p>Wales has the highest proportion of excess deaths and mortality rates in the region are still 15
                        per cent above the usual rate.</p>
                    <p>Data from the ONS reveals there were 10,709 deaths registered in England and Wales in the first
                        week of June.</p>

                    <p>It says that 732 of these were excess.</p>
                    <p>However doubt has been cast by some experts who say the coronavirus death toll could actually be
                        lower than is being reported by the government.</p>
                    <p>Former WHO chief, Professor Karol Sikora recently said that many medics are putting Covid-19 down
                        as the cause of death when the virus has been present in the system.</p>
                    <p>He said the virus may not have been responsible for many deaths, but that it was noted down as
                        the cause if it was present in the system.</p>
                    <p>Prof Sikora said the death toll could be "less than half the official toll".</p>
                    <p>The ONS data found that there had been 1,588 deaths mentioning the coronavirus on the death
                        certificate in the first week of June.</p>

                    <p>Excess deaths are a way of measuring how many deaths would usually have been expected during
                        different parts of the year.</p>
                    <p>The latest figures from the ONS suggest that the number of deaths in hospitals is lower than the
                        five year average.</p>
                    <p>However the UK government has reported that there have been nearly 42,000 deaths in hospitals.
                    </p>
                    <p>The ONS data states there has been 538 less deaths than the five year average.</p>
                    <p>These figures do not include the excess death toll in care homes.</p>
                    <p>Care homes have been at the centre of the pandemic with many homes having lost multiple residents
                        to the virus.</p>
                    <p>Deaths in private homes accounted for 5 percent of all deaths.</p>
                    <p>However this is 40 per cent above the average.</p>

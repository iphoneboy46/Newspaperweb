                    <p>LUTON, Slough, Blackpool and Northampton have seen the biggest job losses as a percentage of
                        population since lockdown began and 600,000 are unemployed nationwide.</p>
                    <p>Shocking new analysis has mapped the extent of unemployment and the country's worst
                        and least hit areas - with Oxford, Cambridge and York suffering the smallest number of losses.
                    </p>

                    <p>According to Centre for Cities, Luton was Britain's worst-hit city - with 6,560 people
                        putting in new claims for unemployment benefits from March to May this year - the largest
                        increase at 4.9 per cent.</p>
                    <p>Slough had a similar percentage increase, with 4,610 new claims for benefits.</p>
                    <p>London had the highest number of people who lost jobs - the sixth-worst city - with a
                        quarter of a million people in the nation's capital putting in fresh claims - an increase of 4.4
                        per cent.</p>
                    <p>In just the last month, 4,150 people in Luton, 3,970 people in Northampton and 2,650
                        people in Slough put in new claims for unemployment benefits.</p>

                    <p>Across the country there are now 2.7 million people claiming unemployment benefits, an
                        increase of 1.4 million from March to May.</p>
                    <p>Oxford, Cambridge and York were the cities that escaped the worst of the job losses -
                        they all had increases of around 2.5 per cent in unemployment claims.</p>
                    <p>That still means 2,505 people in Oxford, 2,040 people in Cambridge and 3,265 people in
                        York were forced to fall back on unemployment benefits since the start of the pandemic.

                    </p>
                    <p>According to Centre for Cities, unemployment hit economically weaker towns and cities
                        in the first months of lockdown.</p>
                    <p>But in the last month that damage has spread throughout the country, and places with
                        stronger economies bore the brunt of job losses - showing the impact of the pandemic had taken
                        longer to spread south.</p>
                    <p>The analysis comes after the Office for National Statistics released shocking new
                        numbers showing at least 600,000 people had lost jobs nationwide.</p>

                    <p>Early estimates from the ONS suggest 163,000 people lost their jobs in May, on top of
                        449,000 the previous month.</p>
                    <p>The ONS explained the numbers suggested a two per cent fall in paid employees since
                        the country went into lockdown on March 23.</p>
                    <p>More than 3.2 million people have claimed Universal Credit since the start of the
                        lockdown, according to the ONS.</p>
                    <p>Manchester and Birmingham were also hit hard by unemployment numbers - with 60,540 and
                        59,135 new claims respectively.</p>
                    <p>Both had an increase of just below four per cent.</p>
